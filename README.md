## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CUBE CSS methodology

### What I learned

- This was one complicated challenge for me since I was rusty with the grid. It made me go through some old notes and articles to reinforce or "make resurface" the grid knowledge. I'm actually impressed I came up with a soluton faster than I thought.

- This was also that challenge that made me deal with the differences within resolutions when the containers are grid-based, and probably why percentages sometimes can get tricky when applied to container widths. Nevertheless, this was one great experience that makes dive a bit more into grids.


### Continued development

I really hope to do more projects where grid is applied, so I can improve my skills on that.

### Useful resources

- [An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid â€¢ Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - This was such a good resource for when I got stuck thinking about how to even start working with the grid.
- [Basic concepts of grid layout - CSS | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout) - Great for quick checks on the grid interrogants.
